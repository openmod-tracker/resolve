# RESOLVE

Welcome to the new `RESOLVE` documentation! These docs are periodically updated and improved for better user experience. 

`RESOLVE` is a least-cost capacity expansion model that identifies optimal electricity supply portfolios through capacity 
expansion and production simulation modeling. Optimal investment plans account for the capital costs of new resources, 
the variable costs of reliably operating the grid, and additional values such as environmental attributes. 
`RESOLVE` has been used to support resource planning and valuation for dozens of clients across North America.

More detailed information along with relevant projects and reports that have leaned on RESOLVE can be found on
[this webpage](https://www.ethree.com/tools/resolve/).

`RESOLVE` was initially developed in 2014 to assess the investment needs of systems seeking to integrate large quantities of variable renewable resources. Since then, many new modeling features and developments are done to enhance the modeling capabilities. The latest version is RESOLVE 3.0, released in summer 2025.


## `RESOLVE` Data Flow

`RESOLVE` uses a combination of Excel spreadsheet, Jupyter notebooks, and Python scripts. 
This documentation will briefly cover each step.

### Kicking it off

Now that we have some background on what `RESOLVE` is, let's 
understand and walk through the steps of running `RESOLVE` and plan clean and reliable electric systems. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèóÔ∏è
