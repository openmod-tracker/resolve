## RESOLVE Scenario Tool

The RESOLVE Scenario Tool is a user-centric model interface, designed to link data, inputs, assumptions, and constraints with the RESOLVE code. The primary step in being able to make that linkage is making sure that xlwings is correctly set-up.

### Overview of Data Flow to RESOLVE Model

The main data are organized in RESOLVE upstream workbooks, and is recommended to collect and format key input datasets into template tables, most importantly for baseline, load and candidate resource data, for easy data transfer to the RESOLVE model. While these workbooks are available and accessible for review of data inputs, users should not need to edit these files and can instead directly rely on Scenario Tool for reviewing or using the data.

Additional details are also covered in the FAQ section. Comprehensive information on the key inputs and assumptions present in the Scenario Tool can be found in the [Inputs & Assumptions document](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/-/media/cpuc-website/divisions/energy-division/documents/integrated-resource-plan-and-long-term-procurement-plan-irp-ltpp/2024-2026-irp-cycle-events-and-materials/draft-2025-inputs-and-assumptions-document.pdf) released by the CPUC. For users planning on comprehensively using the Model, a thorough reading of the I&A document is recommended.
