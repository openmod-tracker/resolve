# This is a pre-processing step aimed at **reducing cluster problem size** by only including profiles that are more distinct and informative to day sampling process.
#
# ![img.svg](img/daysample_input_profile_check.svg)
#
#
# Note that the choice of threshold, whether more stringent or relaxed, directly affects the number of profiles retained for clustering.
# > For example, solar resources often exhibit similar diurnal generation patterns, leading to high correlation among profiles. In such cases, using a higher threshold can be appropriate. As a reference, the CPUC IRP applies a 90% threshold for both wind and solar.

#
# This step implemeted a grid searching process to **automate search from a range of weights** and find a few set of clusters that‚Äôs identified as ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù in the sense that it minimizes clustering error.
#
# >It is intended to **zoom into top X set of weights** that could bring generic error metrics down, instead of finding the one ‚Äúbest‚Äù sample day selection.
#
# ‚ùó After specifying the range of weight, run the loop below to create different set of cluster results and visuals. You can use these charts as additional screening to closely evaluate the quality of reconstituted 8760 profiles. Some screening criteria include:

# ## Optional: Force a Higher Weight for Extreme Days
#
# Representative period selection aims to find the best **"average" day** to summarize a much longer timeframe of data. However, sometimes we want to **_manually include extreme days_** to cover a broader range of challenging load and renewable patterns.
#
# <span style="color:#FFAF00;"><strong>In this section, you can specify a list of days you consider "challenging."</strong></span> The clustering algorithm will then be directed to assign the closest <span style="color:#FFAF00;"><strong>X number of days</strong></span> in the chronological periods to be represented by each challenging day.
#
# > <i>For example, suppose <span style="color:#034E6E;"><strong>"2016-02-02"</strong></span> is identified as a challenging day with high load and low renewable output, but it was not selected by the clusterer as a representative period. You can assign the closest <span style="color:#034E6E;"><strong>2 to 3 days</strong></span> (roughly 1-in-10 in a 20-year weather dataset) in the chronological periods to be represented by this challenging day. This way, you introduce more difficult scenarios into the RESOLVE simulations.</i>
#
# > <span style="color:#034E6E;"><strong>Tip:</strong></span> The number of days and how many closest days to assign is an <em>art</em> ‚Äî it depends on how many challenging situations you want to include in your model.
